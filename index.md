Mixed feelings on this. On the one hand I totally agree, it's OK to not code outside work. On the other, as a member of a hiring team, I really like to see candidates who are active in the community, have side-projects, and show a passion for coding. That said, I also like to see a candidate with other interests, helping them meld with the team in other ways, and around other interests. That puts me somewhere in the middle - for me personally, and what I look for in candidates.

Surprised by some of the tech, tbh
